# Heating, cooling, and power consumption forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) for energy efficiency and intelligent management of smart buildings in the cold environment
# Project Summery:
Through the advancement of technology in different fields, many issues have been resolved in the modern day. On the other side, concerns have arisen owing to excessive energy usage. One of these issues is environmental contamination, which threatens the world's future. This research examines one of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms known as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to comprehend how it is feasible to forecast the office building's energy. The objective is to simulate an office in the cold climate city of Winnipeg, Canada, collect data on the four parameters of Power Electricity, Power Heating, Power Cooling, and Total Power, and then examine the LSTM for forecasting parameters for the following year in order to comprehend and online monitoring the performance of the model under varying conditions. The model assessment demonstrates the model's acceptable performance in a new context.
